# AoE2 Strategies Reference

## Build Orders

### Scouts into Knights (Franks Standard)
1. **Dark Age (6 vills on sheep, 4 on wood, 1 lure boar)**
   - Queue villagers non-stop
   - Lure both boars
   - 3 on berries (or more sheep)
   - Build 2 houses immediately
2. **22 pop → Feudal** (click ~8:00-8:30)
   - Loom before or after click (before if under pressure)
   - Build Barracks at ~60% Feudal
3. **Feudal** (~10:00-10:30)
   - Build Stable immediately
   - 3-4 Scouts for harassment
   - Build farms as wood allows (priority: 6 farms before clicking Castle)
   - Second Lumber Camp when needed
4. **Castle Age** (~18:00-20:00)
   - 2 more Stables → Knight production
   - Second TC
   - Continuous Knight + Villager production

### Fast Castle (Arena/Closed Maps)
1. 28-29 pop → Castle Age directly
2. Skip Feudal military
3. Boom with 3 TCs in Castle
4. Knights or unique unit from Castle

### Archer Rush (Generic)
1. 22 pop → Feudal
2. Archery Range + Blacksmith
3. 5-6 Archers → harass gold/woodlines
4. Add Skirmishers if opponent makes archers
5. Transition to Crossbow in Castle

## Key Principles

### Economy Management
- **Never idle TC** — always producing villagers (until 120-130 in late game)
- **Farm reseeds** — reseed immediately when farms expire
- **Villager distribution** — roughly 40% food, 30% wood, 20% gold, 10% stone (varies by strategy)
- **Second TC** — build immediately upon reaching Castle Age

### Military Timing
- **Feudal military** — minimum 2-3 units by minute 12 for defense/pressure
- **Don't stockpile resources** — if you have >500 of anything, you should be spending it
- **Counter units** — always scout what opponent is making and adapt

### Adaptation
- **Opponent makes archers** → add Skirmishers or go Knights
- **Opponent makes cavalry** → Spearmen/Camels + ranged support
- **Opponent makes infantry** → Archers, Scorpions, or cavalry mobility
- **Opponent walls and booms** → pressure or match the boom

### Common Mistakes at 500-700 ELO
1. **TC idle time** — forgetting to queue villagers during fights
2. **Late military** — having zero military units past Feudal
3. **No adaptation** — making same units regardless of what opponent does
4. **Resource floating** — having 1000+ of a resource and not spending it
5. **No scouting** — not knowing what opponent is doing
6. **Over-walling** — spending too much time/resources on walls instead of military
7. **Single TC** — staying on 1 TC well into Castle Age
