# AoE2 Knowledge Base

Domain-specific knowledge for match analysis and coaching.

## Tracked (generic, shipped with repo)

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `civilizations.json` | Civ bonuses, strengths, weaknesses, counters |
| `benchmarks.json` | Age-up targets by ELO bracket |
| `matchups.json` | Matchup theory and counter strategies |
| `strategies.md` | Build orders, principles, common mistakes |
| `coaching-rules.md` | IF/THEN coaching rule engine |

These files contain **generic AoE2 knowledge** applicable to any player. They are curated and version-controlled.

## Not Tracked (personal, gitignored)

| File | Description | Generated by |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `player-profile.json` | Player strengths, weaknesses, trends | `patterns.py` |

This file is **auto-generated from your personal match data** and should not be committed. It's recreated every time `patterns.py` runs (after each match or via `agelytics patterns`).

## How It's Used

1. **Framework** (`agelytics patterns`) generates `data/patterns.json` + `player-profile.json`
2. **OpenClaw Integration** loads KB files as context for AI analysis (Deep Coach)
3. **Coaching Rules** can be evaluated programmatically or by an LLM against match data

## Contributing

- Edit generic files directly, update `last_updated` field
- Don't edit `player-profile.json` — it's auto-generated
- Add new civs to `civilizations.json` as the community evolves
- Add matchup entries after they become well-understood
