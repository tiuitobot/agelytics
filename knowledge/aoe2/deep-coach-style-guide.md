# Deep Coach — Style Guide

## Structure (in order)

1. **Forensic Analysis intro** — 2-3 sentences: what this match exposes, the core pattern
2. **Matchup Context** — How this civ matchup plays theoretically, player's history in it, correct approach
3. **Phase-by-phase analysis:**
   - **Phase 1: Dark Age** — Key decisions, timings, assessment, "What to do differently"
   - **Phase 2: Feudal Age** — Same structure
   - **Phase 3: Castle Age** — Same structure (+ Imperial if reached)
   - Each phase ends with concrete "What to do differently"
4. **Non-Obvious Insights** — 3-4 insights the player probably didn't notice. Named insights (e.g. "The Spearman Trap", "The Farm Gap Paradox"). Data-driven, not obvious.
5. **Cross-Match Patterns** — Recurring patterns from player profile (numbered, with data)
6. **Prioritized Action Plan** — URGENT / HIGH / MEDIUM items with specific targets
7. **Benchmarks for Next Game** — Table: metric | current | target
8. **Score: X/10** — What went right, what went wrong, path to higher scores

## Tone

- Coach, not professor
- Direct and specific — data > opinion
- "What to do differently" not "What went wrong"
- Contradictions called out explicitly ("walled 69 tiles despite having tempo advantage")
- Causal chains, not independent error lists

## Language

- Default: Portuguese (BR)
- English if user requests
- Redact usernames to "Player 1" / "Player 2" if requested

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Generic timeline without phase structure
- ❌ Coaching rules as mechanical checklist
- ❌ Academic tone ("It is observed that...")
- ❌ Insights disconnected from game phases
- ❌ Listing errors without causal chain
